        Most people will spend their lives chasing a career they were never meant for.  
        Trapped in a loop of decisions they didn't understand, advice they blindly followed,  
        and outcomes they now regret.  
      </p>
      <p>
        But you're not like them. You stopped here.  
        You questioned the path. You sensed the misalignment.  
        SkillAI exists to confirm that intuition.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't just an AI giving suggestions.  
        This is your roadmap â€” shaped by your <strong>skills</strong>, your <strong>mind</strong>, and your <strong>potential</strong>.  
        This is the one decision you owe your future.
