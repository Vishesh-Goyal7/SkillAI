## 🧠 Backend Walkthrough
- **Skill Selection :** Dynamically select selects as per your skill set from the frontend. 
- **Career Cluster Finding :** The XGBoost model deployed on the backend first selects suitable cluster. 
- **Career Picker :** DNN models specific to each cluster finds most suitable jobs from each cluster. 
- **Captum Explainer :** A Captum model derives the list of all the factors that contributed positively/negatively to prediction.
- **IBM WatsonX API :** Reads the Captum generated explanations and creates a detailed human readable report about why career was chosen.

```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv  #(Do this in the)
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install  

**Create a .env file with PORT=9123 and your IBM_API_KEY, IBM_SERVICE_URL and IBM_PROJECT_ID**

node index.js
```
